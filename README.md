- 🔐 **Concurrent Processing Protection**: Thread-safe operations with mutex locks for reliable multi-file processing

## 🏗️ Architecture

The service consists of several modular components:

- 🎯 **transcript_service.py**: Main service orchestrator that coordinates all components
- 👀 **monitor.py**: Folder monitoring using file system events for efficient resource usage
- 🔗 **transcriber.py**: AssemblyAI API integration with error handling and retry logic
- ⚙️ **config.py**: Configuration management and environment variable handling

   ```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikedgit/Auto-Transcript-Agent.git
   cd Auto-Transcript-Agent
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

3. **Install as a macOS service:**
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/install_service.py install
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# AssemblyAI Configuration
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SPEECH_MODEL=best  # Options: best, nano

# Directory Configuration
INPUT_DIR=/path/to/input/folder
OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output/folder
DONE_DIR=/path/to/done/folder

# Service Configuration
POLL_INTERVAL=5  # Seconds between directory checks
MAX_RETRIES=3    # Maximum retry attempts for failed transcriptions
RETRY_DELAY=60   # Seconds to wait between retries

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FILE=/var/log/auto-transcript-agent.log
```

### Configuration Options

#### Speech Models
- **best**: Highest accuracy, slower processing
- **nano**: Faster processing, good accuracy for most use cases

#### Directory Structure
```
/your/base/path/
├── input/     # Place audio files here
├── output/    # Transcripts appear here
└── done/      # Processed audio files moved here
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The service provides a comprehensive CLI for various operations:

```bash
# Show all available commands
uv run python -m src.transcript_service --help

# Run the service manually (for testing)
uv run python -m src.transcript_service run

# Check service status
uv run python -m src.transcript_service status

# Transcribe a single audio file
uv run python -m src.transcript_service transcribe audio_file.mp3

# Initialize configuration file
uv run python -m src.transcript_service init-config
```

### Service Management

Use the installation script for service management:

```bash
# Install and start the service
uv run python scripts/install_service.py install

# Check service status
uv run python scripts/install_service.py status

# Restart the service
uv run python scripts/install_service.py restart

# Uninstall the service
uv run python scripts/install_service.py uninstall
```

### Alternative Service Management (Direct launchctl)

```bash
# Start the service
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.autotranscript.plist

# Stop the service
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.autotranscript.plist

# Check service status
launchctl list | grep autotranscript
```

### Processing Audio Files

1. Place audio files in the configured input directory
2. The service automatically detects new files
3. Transcription begins using AssemblyAI API
4. Completed transcripts are saved to the output directory as `.txt` files
5. Original audio files are moved to the done directory

### Output Format

Transcripts are saved as plain text files with the same base name as the audio file:
- `meeting_recording.mp3` → `meeting_recording.txt`
- `interview.wav` → `interview.txt`

## 🎵 Supported Audio Formats

- 🎶 MP3 (.mp3)
- 🎤 WAV (.wav)
- 📱 M4A (.m4a)
- 🎧 FLAC (.flac)
- 📻 AAC (.aac)
- 🔊 OGG (.ogg)
- 🌐 WEBM (.webm)

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
uv run pytest tests/test_transcriber.py -v
```

## Performance

### Real-World Performance
Based on production testing:
- **Processing Speed**: 3-30 seconds per audio file (depending on length and model)
- **Throughput**: Processes multiple files concurrently with race condition protection
- **Accuracy**: High-quality transcriptions using AssemblyAI's "best" model
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate in testing with proper error handling

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~50-100MB during operation
- **CPU**: Low usage during monitoring, moderate during transcription
- **Network**: Depends on audio file sizes and AssemblyAI API usage
- **Storage**: Minimal overhead, original files moved to done folder

### Optimization Tips
- Use the `nano` model for faster processing if accuracy requirements are flexible
- Monitor API usage and credits in your AssemblyAI dashboard
- Consider implementing file size limits for very large audio files
- Use network directories for centralized processing

## Security

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- No sensitive data is logged
- File permissions are respected for all operations
- Network traffic uses HTTPS encryption
